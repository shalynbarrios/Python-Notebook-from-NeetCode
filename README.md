# Python-Notebook-from-NeetCode

This is my collection of Python Google Colab notebooks based on NeetCode (not Leetcode) lessons and problems that I've taught my students. Each notebook includes small notes and explanations. I cover the following topics:

1. Mathematics/Built-in Operations
2. Functions
3. Conditional Statements
4. Loops
5. Advanced String Functions
6. Lists
7. Tuples
8. Sets
9. Dictionaries

You might find some files are long or short - it just depends if I was in person or not. There is more being added into this repository almost every single day.
