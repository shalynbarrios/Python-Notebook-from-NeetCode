# Python-Notebook-from-NeetCode

Hi everyone! My name is Shay. This is my collection of Python Google Colab notebooks based on NeetCode lessons and problems that I've taught my students. Each notebook includes small notes and explanations. I cover the following topics:

1. Mathematics/Built-in Operations
2. Functions
3. Conditional Statements
4. Loops
5. Advanced String Functions
6. Lists

There is more being added into this repository almost every single day. Thanks for stopping by!
